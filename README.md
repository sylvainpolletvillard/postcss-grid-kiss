# grid-kiss: Keep CSS Grids simple, stupid

[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/sylvainpolletvillard/postcss-grid-kiss](https://badges.gitter.im/sylvainpolletvillard/postcss-grid-kiss.svg)](https://gitter.im/sylvainpolletvillard/postcss-grid-kiss?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

This is a [PostCSS][postcss-website] plugin aiming to replace the 24 new properties brought by [CSS Grids][w3c-spec] with a single one that you immediately understand when you see it.

## Example

```css
body {
	grid-kiss:
		"+-------------------------------+      "
		"|           header ↑            | 120px"
		"+-------------------------------+      "
		"                                       "
		"+-- 30% ---+  +--- auto --------+      "
		"| .sidebar |  |       main      | auto "
		"+----------+  +-----------------+      "
		"                                       "
		"+-------------------------------+      "
		"|              ↓                | 60px "
		"|         → footer ←            |      "
		"+-------------------------------+      "
}
```

is converted to:

```css
body > header {
	grid-area: header;
	align-self: start
}

body > .sidebar {
	grid-area: sidebar
}

body > main {
	grid-area: main
}

body > footer {
	grid-area: footer;
	justify-self: center;
	align-self: end
}

body {
	display: grid;
	align-content: space-between;
	grid-template-rows: 120px 1fr 60px;
	grid-template-columns: 30% 1fr;
	grid-template-areas: 
	"header  header"
	"sidebar main  "
	"footer  footer"
}
```

which displays this kind of grid layout:

## [Try it online][playground]

Try the different examples and play with the plugin on the [playground][playground]. Edit the CSS and HTML on the left and the grid will be updated instantly.

You can also try the plugin [on Codepen with this template][codepen] thanks to [@jonathanneal](https://github.com/jonathantneal)

## Responsive layouts

Use different `grid-kiss` declarations in media queries to easily get responsive layouts. It is recommended to start by the grid on small screens, then use media queries to progressively enhance your layouts on wider screens.

```

## Installation

- with [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
```bash
yarn add postcss-grid-kiss --dev
```

- with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
```bash
npm install postcss-grid-kiss --save-dev
```

## Usage

If you never used PostCSS before, read [PostCSS usage documentation](https://github.com/postcss/postcss#usage) first.

- with command line interface :

```bash
postcss src/your.css --output dist/compiled.css --use postcss-grid-kiss
```

- with Node:
```js
const postcss  = require('postcss'),
      gridkiss = require('postcss-grid-kiss');

postcss([ gridkiss ])
    .process(css, { from: 'src/your.css', to: 'compiled.css' })
    .then(function (result) {
        fs.writeFileSync('compiled.css', result.css);
        if( result.map ) fs.writeFileSync('compiled.css.map', result.map);
    });
```

Read PostCSS documentation for usage with Gulp, Webpack, Grunt or other build systems.

## Options

Grid-kiss comes with a few options: 
```javascript
postcss([ gridkiss({ ...options }) ])
```

### `browsers` : specify the list of browsers to support

**Note: it is recommended to declare browserslist config in `package.json` instead of using this option, so that other plugins can reuse the configuration. See [browserslist docs][browserslist].**

```javascript
postcss([ gridkiss({ browsers: ["last 2 versions", "> 1%"] }) ])
```

### `fallback` : add fallback for browsers not supporting CSS Grid Layout 

**Note: it is recommended to use automatic detection through browserslist instead of using this option. See [Fallback](#fallback-for-older-browsers) section.**

By default, Grid-kiss is looking for your list of supported browsers (see `browsers` option) and automatically deduce what fallbacks are needed, using [Can I Use][can-i-use] data. If this option is provided, it overrides automatic detection and tells explicitely whether to add or not the fallback styles to the output. 

```javascript
postcss([ gridkiss({ fallback: true }) ]) // always add all fallbacks
postcss([ gridkiss({ fallback: false }) ]) // never add any fallback
```

### `optimize` - reduce output size

This option *(enabled by default)* reduces the size of the output while keeping it readable. It does so by merging grid properties and renaming zone identifiers. For complete minification, use it with [cssnano](http://cssnano.co/).

Set this option to `false` if you prefer a more verbose and descriptive output. Try to toggle the option in the [playground][playground] to compare.

```javascript
postcss([ gridkiss({ optimize: false }) ])
```


## Fallback for older browsers

As of February 2017, [CSS Grid Layout][w3c-spec] specification is a Candidate Recommandation and is not widely supported. It is available in Chrome 57, Firefox 52, Safari 10.1 and Opera 44. See [Can I Use][can-i-use] for more information on browser support. Microsoft Edge implements an older and unusable version of this specification. All the major browser editors are currently working on it and we can hope for a decent browser support at mid-2017.

Lots of people are looking for a polyfill for Grid layout but unfortunately, **it is impossible to make a pure CSS polyfill that is fully compliant with the Grid spec, because it let you do things that were not possible before**.

What Grid-kiss proposes is not a polyfill, but a fallback that tries to simulate CSS Grid Layout with absolute positionning and `calc()` operator. This does not require JavaScript and only applies on browsers not supporting CSS Grid Layout, thanks to a `@supports` query.

By default, Grid-kiss is looking in your [browserslist][browserslist] config for the list of supported browsers and automatically deduce what fallbacks are needed for your project by using [Can I Use data][can-i-use]. You can override this automatic detection with the `browsers` and `fallback` options.

**With this fallback, Grid-kiss layouts will work on any browser supporting `calc()`, which is like [90% of browsers](http://caniuse.com/#search=calc).** But you should note that a fallback based on absolute positionning is very far from the awesomeness of CSS Grid Layout. You have to be aware of these limitations:

- It is only a fallback for `grid-kiss` declarations. The reason this fallback works is because of the constraints I have set for grid-kiss layouts. Implicit grid definition would not work for example, without JavaScript and DOM knowledge.
- Other Grid Layout properties such as `grid-gap` are not covered by this fallback.
- New dimensions properties defined in the Grid layout specification such as `min-content`, `max-content`, `minmax()`, `fit-content` also are not supported
- Zones with `position: absolute` are out of the flow. This implies that the container will no longer resize based on the zones content. Grid-kiss tries to calculate the total size of the grid when possible. If one of the rows/columns dimensions is `auto` or a fraction of the remaining space (`fr`), the height/width is set to `100%`.
- Grid-kiss adds the property `box-sizing: border-box` to each zone so that they don't overlap because of their padding or border size. If you don't already use this property, it may change a bit the zones dimensions.
- The CSS output is significally bigger, between 2x and 3x in size depending on the targeted browsers

Internet Explorer does not support `@supports` 🙄 , so Grid-kiss needs to add another media query hack that is known to run only on IE: `@media screen and (min-width:\0)`. This extends support from **IE9 to IE11** at the cost of a bigger output size. If you don't care about Internet Explorer support and want to reduce the output size, you should omit IE in your [browserslist][browserslist].

## Properties used in the Grid Layout specification

### on the grid

- `display: grid` ✅
- `grid-template-columns` ✅
- `grid-template-rows` ✅
- `grid-template-areas` ✅
- `grid-column-gap` ❌ [1]
- `grid-row-gap` ❌ [1]

[1]: gaps are actually faked as empty zones, so you can define the gap dimension specifically by row/column. See [Gaps Dimensions](#gaps-dimensions)

[2]: `justify-items` and `align-items` are not used on the container level, instead use alignment helpers for each zone

[3]: `grid-auto-columns`, `grid-auto-rows` and `grid-auto-flow` are not used, instead define explicitely all the zones

[4]: `grid-kiss` aims to replace the `grid` property

### on the zones (a.k.a. grid items)

- `grid-column-start` ❌ [5]
- `grid-column-end` ❌ [5]
- `grid-row-start` ❌ [5]
- `grid-row-end` ❌ [5]

[5] named areas are used instead of indexes

## Documentation

### How to draw a grid

- Draw the different zones of your grid as shown in the example. You can use some tools like [AsciiFlow](http://asciiflow.com/).
- Inside every zone, write a CSS selector that matches the corresponding element. It can be a `tag` name, a `.class`, an `#id`, or `any.other[valid]#selector`
- The elements matched have to be **direct descendants** of the grid element
- Separate each row by a newline (`\n`) and give the same indentation level to every row
- Make sure each row starts and end by a double quote `"`
- Make sure the zone corners (`+`) are correctly aligned. Every index in the rows where a corner character is found creates a new column.
- Do not hesitate to make large zones with unused space, it may be useful for future modifications
- Use Insert. key and Multi-cursor if supported by your editor to draw and edit your grids easily

### Dimensions of rows

Declare the size of a row by writing the dimension **just after the last column of the grid**
```
+------+  +------+ --- 
|  ^   |  | .bar | 40em
|      |  +------+ --- 
| .baz |               
|      |  +------+ --- 
|  v   |  |  ^   | 38em
+------+  |      | --- 
          | .foo |     
+------+  |      | --- 
| .qux |  |  v   | 40em
+------+  +------+ --- 
```

The `-` separators between dimensions are not mandatory, they are only here to make the grid more readable.

### Dimensions of columns

Declare the size of a column by writing the dimension **inside the top or bottom border of a zone**:

```
+-- 640px --+      +----------+
|  selector |  or  | selector |
+-----------+      +---30%----+
```

You cannot set the width of a zone occupying more than one column. This would imply some calculations that may or may not have a solution. As an alternative, you can declare the size of a column **just after the last row of the grid**:

```
+-------------+ +-----+        +-------------+ +-20%-+
|  .bigzone   | |     |        |  .bigzone   | |     |
+-------------+ +-----+        +-------------+ +-----+            
+-----+ +-------------+   or   +-----+ +-------------+
|     | |  .bigzone2  |        |     | |  .bigzone2  |
+-----+ +-------------+        +-20%-+ +-------------+
| 20% | | 60% | | 20% |                | 60% |                 
```

The `|` separators between dimensions are not mandatory, they are only here to make the grid more readable.

### Gaps dimensions

You can also declare the dimension of spacing between zones the same way you do with rows and columns. These spaces are called *gaps* and act like empty zones. The example below defines gaps of *50px*.

```
+-----+      +-----+      +-----+  ----
| .nw |      | .n  |      | .ne | 100px
+-----+      +-----+      +-----+  ----		   
                                   50px	   
+-----+      +-----+      +-----+  ----
| .w  |      |     |      | .e  | 100px
+-----+      +-----+      +-----+  ----
                                   50px   
+-----+      +-----+      +-----+  ----
| .sw |      | .s  |      | .se | 100px
+-----+      +-----+      +-----+  ----
|100px| 50px |100px| 50px |100px|           
```

### Values accepted for dimensions

Dimensions can be any of the specified values:

- a non-negative length. 
  - `15px`
  - `4rem`

- a non-negative percentage value, optionally with a context keyword
  - `20%`
  - `25% free` ⇒ `25fr`
  - `30% grid` ⇒ `30%`
  - `5% view` ⇒ `5vw` or `5vh` depending on the direction
  
- a non-negative number representing a fraction of the free space in the grid container.
  - `5` ⇒ `5fr`
  
- `max` or `max-content`: a keyword representing the largest maximal content contribution of the grid items occupying the grid track

- `min` or `min-content`: a keyword representing the largest minimal content contribution of the grid items occupying the grid track

- a range between a minimum and a maximum or `minmax(min, max)`
  - `100px - 200px` ⇒ `minmax(100px, 200px)`

- `> *length*` or `< *length*`: a minimum or maximum value
  - `> 100px` ⇒ `minmax(100px, auto)`
  - `< 50%` ⇒ `minmax(auto, 50%)`
  
- `fit *length*` or `fit-content(*length*)`: a keyword representing the formula min(max-content, max(auto, *length*)), which is calculated similar to auto (i.e. minmax(auto, max-content)), except that the track size is clamped at argument *length* if it is greater than the auto minimum.
  - `fit 100px` ⇒ `fit-content(100px)`
  
- `calc( expr )` : an expression using native [calc()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/calc) CSS function  

- `auto`:  a keyword representing one part of the remaining free space, i.e. `1fr`. When used as a maximum value, it is equal to `max-content`. When used as a minimum value,  it it is equal to `min-content`.

When no value is specified, row and column sizes are set as `auto`

### Selector helpers

Since 1.2.0, selectors in zones may use some shortened notations specific to grid-kiss, although using a class is still the recommended method.

- `:1` ⇒ `*:nth-child(1)`
- `button:2` ⇒ `button:nth-of-type(2)`

### Horizontal alignment of the grid

Specifies how all the zones are aligned horizontally inside the grid container. Irrelevant if one of the zones fits all the remaining free space.
